Hi, I'm Saad Hussain

Aspiring **DevOps Engineer** passionate about automation, cloud, and building scalable systems.  
I'm documenting my journey step by step — from Linux fundamentals to full CI/CD pipelines — here on GitHub.

This repository documents everything I’ve learned and practiced in DevOps — organized by skill.  
Each folder represents a topic (Linux, Shell Scripting, Docker, etc.) with notes, exercises, and projects.



##  Contents

- `linux-essentials/` → Linux basics: commands, permissions, users, processes
- `shell-scripting/` → Bash scripting for automation and system tasks
- `docker/` → Dockerfiles, Dockerimages, Compose, container projects
- `ci-cd/` → GitHub Actions & Gitlab pipelines
- `terraform/` → Infrastructure as Code (AWS examples)
- `kubernetes/` → Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Helm charts



##  Completed Skills

-  **Linux Essentials** → commands, permissions, processes, services  
-  **Shell Scripting** → automation scripts (loops, cron jobs, system tasks)  
-  **Git & GitHub** → version control, branching, workflows, GitHub Actions basics  
-  **GitLab** → repositories, GitLab CI/CD, sample pipelines  
-  **Docker** → images, containers, Dockerfiles, Docker Compose, mini projects  




##  Currently Learning

- Writing efficient Dockerfiles  
- Multi-container setups with Docker Compose  
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions & GitLab CI  
-**AWS Cloud & Networking basics** (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Subnets, Routing)  




## Next Topics

- Terraform basics (Infrastructure as Code for AWS)  
- Kubernetes fundamentals (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps)  
- Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana  
- Advanced Cloud concepts
