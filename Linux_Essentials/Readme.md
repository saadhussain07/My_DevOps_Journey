# Linux Essentials

This folder contains my Linux learning notes and practice examples.  
Linux is the backbone of DevOps, so I focused on the most important commands, concepts, and system administration basics.

## Contents

- `commands.md` → Basic navigation & file management  
- `permissions.md` → File permissions, ownership, and access control  
- `users-and-groups.md` → Managing users, groups, and sudo  
- `processes.md` → Monitoring and managing processes  
- `services.md` → System services using systemctl & journalctl  
- `networking.md` → Networking tools (ping, curl, netstat, ip)  

## Skills Learned

- Navigating Linux filesystem  
- Managing files, directories, and permissions  
- Creating & managing users and groups  
- Monitoring running processes and system performance  
- Controlling services with systemd  
- Basic networking commands for troubleshooting
